# Real-Time Emotion Detection from Text üí¨üß†

A web application that identifies human emotions (like joy, sadness, anger, etc.) from user-entered text using a custom-trained Machine Learning model. Developed as part of the **Summer School on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì 2025**.

## üîç Features

- Real-time text input for emotion classification  
- Six emotion categories: `joy`, `sadness`, `anger`, `fear`, `love`, `surprise`  
- Trained using Logistic Regression on a TF-IDF vectorized dataset  
- Clean and responsive frontend UI using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**  
- Lightweight **Flask** backend serving the model predictions  
- Entirely based on a flat file structure (no folders)
